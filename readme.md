# SuperTech 1.12.2

SuperTech is a reimagining and rebalance of GT3. This mod is not finished and is missing features.
Also, the code quality is quite variable. Some areas may have passable code and other areas have truly horrifying code.
If you want to contribute to the development of SuperTech, feel free to fork and submit a pull request.
